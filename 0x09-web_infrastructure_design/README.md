## üåê Infrastructure Components

### 1. What is a Server?
A **server** is a computer (or software system) that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers‚Äîknown as **clients**‚Äîover a network. In this setup, the server hosts the website and handles requests from users.

---

### 2. What is the Role of the Domain Name?
A **domain name** (e.g., `www.foobar.com`) is a human-readable identifier that maps to the IP address of a server. It allows users to access a website without needing to remember its numeric IP address.

---

### 3. What Type of DNS Record is ‚Äòwww‚Äô in `www.foobar.com`?
The `www` is a **subdomain**. It is commonly mapped in DNS using:
- An **A (Address) record** ‚Üí Points `www.foobar.com` directly to an IP address.
- A **CNAME (Canonical Name) record** ‚Üí Maps `www.foobar.com` to another domain name, such as `foobar.com`.

---

### 4. What is the Role of the Web Server?
A **web server** (e.g., **Nginx**, **Apache**) performs the following:
- Serves static files like HTML, CSS, JS
- Handles HTTPS encryption
- Forwards dynamic requests to the application server
- Manages routing and logs

---

### 5. What is the Role of the Application Server?
An **application server** runs backend logic. It:
- Executes dynamic code (e.g., Python, Node.js, PHP)
- Processes user input and handles logic
- Interacts with the database

Examples: **Gunicorn**, **uWSGI**, **Node.js**.

---

### 6. What is the Role of the Database?
A **database** stores persistent data such as:
- Users, orders, sessions
- Content for the site

Examples: **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**.

---

### 7. How Does the Server Communicate With the User?
The server and client communicate using the **HTTP/HTTPS protocols** over **TCP/IP**. When a user accesses `www.foobar.com`, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which replies with a response rendered in the browser.

## üîß Additional Infrastructure Considerations

### ‚ûï For Every Additional Element, Why You Are Adding It

| Element             | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| **Load Balancer**   | Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve availability and scalability. |
| **Firewall**        | Protects the infrastructure by filtering unauthorized or malicious network traffic. |
| **HTTPS/SSL**       | Encrypts communication between users and the server for secure data transmission. |
| **Monitoring Tools**| Help track system health, performance, and usage metrics for proactive maintenance. |
| **Database Replication** | Ensures high availability and redundancy in case the primary database server fails. |
| **Separate Web, App, DB Servers** | Improves scalability and simplifies troubleshooting by decoupling responsibilities. |

---

## üîê What Are Firewalls For?

A **firewall** is a security system that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It:
- Blocks unauthorized access to the server
- Allows trusted traffic based on defined rules
- Helps prevent DDoS, intrusion, and data leakage

---

## üîí Why Is the Traffic Served Over HTTPS?

HTTPS (HTTP Secure):
- Encrypts data between the user and server using **SSL/TLS**
- Prevents **eavesdropping**, **data tampering**, and **man-in-the-middle attacks**
- Builds **trust** by showing the padlock icon in the browser
- Required for **SEO ranking** and **modern browsers**

---

## üìà What Is Monitoring Used For?

Monitoring tools:
- Track server uptime, CPU/memory usage, disk space, network traffic
- Detect failures or anomalies
- Send alerts when performance drops or errors occur
- Support capacity planning and resource optimization

---

## üìä How Does the Monitoring Tool Collect Data?

Monitoring tools (like Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios):
- Use **agents** or **exporters** installed on the server
- Pull or receive data at intervals via HTTP, SNMP, or logs
- Store metrics in a **time-series database**
- Visualize metrics on **dashboards**

---

## ‚ùì How to Monitor Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second)

To monitor QPS:
1. **Enable access logging** on your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache)
2. Use tools like:
   - `GoAccess`, `AWStats` for log analysis
   - `Prometheus` with Nginx exporter
   - `Grafana` for dashboards
3. Set alerts if QPS exceeds a defined threshold

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Infrastructure Issues

### ‚ùó Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level

- If SSL is **terminated** at the load balancer, traffic between the load balancer and internal servers is **unencrypted**.
- This may expose sensitive data **inside the network**.
- Solution: Use **end-to-end encryption** (TLS passthrough or re-encrypt at backend).

---

### ‚ùó Only One MySQL Server Accepting Writes

- If the **primary MySQL server** goes down, **no write operations** can occur.
- This creates a **single point of failure** and data loss risk.
- Solution: Use **MySQL replication** with **failover** or **clustered databases** like Galera Cluster.

---

### ‚ùó Servers With All the Same Components (Monolithic Setup)

- Every server runs web, app, and database components, which leads to:
  - **Resource contention**
  - **Scaling difficulties** (you can‚Äôt scale web without scaling DB too)
  - **Complex deployments and debugging**
- Solution: Use **tiered architecture**:
  - Web layer
  - Application layer
  - Database layer
